# Word Count Validator

## My Implementation

#### How to Run:
First, assume you have the bundler gem properly installed on your system, run the following command to make sure all necessary gems are installed:
```ruby
    bundle
```

Then, to run the server (which will be hosted on localhost:8000), run:
```
    ./run
```

Or, to run the test suite, run:
```ruby
    rspec
```

#### Assumptions

1. I assumed that the body of the post request would always be in the following json format, where text is a string, exclude is an array, and answer is a hash with string keys pointing
to integers. I do validate this format, and should the body be improperly formatted, it will return 400:

```json
    {
      "text": "The text that we are matching",
      "exclude": ["that", "we"],
      "answer": {
        "the": 1,
        "text": 1,
        "are": 1,
        "matching": 1
      }
    }
```

2. I assumed that the client side will support cookie usage for use in the anti-cheating functionality which I will describe more in the "Implementation Notes" block below. Should you need to disable this functionality, simply run in the same console as your server:
```
    export disable_cheating_prevention=true
```
3. I went ahead and set up the file structure to mimic how a larger sinatra app might look, with an app/ folder containing relevant folders (views, services, and if it was a larger app, models, etc)
4. I assumed that we would want the number of words to exclude to be fairly random upon each request. As such the number of excludes to use is randomize to be between 1 and the number of unique words in the string  - 1.

#### Design Goals

1. My first goal was to make the app.rb route methods as lightweight as possible. This was achieved by delegating all work to Service Objects.
2. My second goal was to make all service objects as single-purpose as possible to minimize any confusion, and easily be able to be dropped and used wherever.

### Implementation Notes

1. I do some minor parameter cleaning to ensure the data is valid and can be processed properly. Specifically, I downcase all strings and remove punctuation.
2. In order to prevent cheating, what I have done is used cookies stored after the get request and then validated on the post request. This cookie is a sha256 hash of the text combined with a joined string of the exclude array. 
When the client attempts to check an answer, the text/exclude that they provide in the body is hashed and compared against their cookie. Should it not match, or not be present, the server returns a 400 status code. My decision
to use cookies is to ensure that the server is completely stateless, and any state-related work is delegated to the client.

## Objective

Recently the internet has exploded to reach across the galaxy.  There is a hostile species of troll aliens that have started infesting the internet with disruptive, angry comments on internet forums.  Scientists have determined that the troll aliens are really bad at counting words.  Thus they have tasked you with creating a type of [CAPTCHA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA) for troll aliens to keep them out of the forums. Trying to be helpful, the scientists have sent along some starter code. It's not complete and some things could probably be done better. To run the scientists' starts code:

        # You can get everything installed using
        bundle install

        # Run the server using
        ruby app.rb

        # Run the test suite via
        rspec

## Description

We want to verify that a client can count words. As such, we need a web service that supplies clients with a "test" and allows the client to submit an answer. If the client and the service were people, their conversation might go something like this:

> **Client**: Service, can you give me some words to count?
> 
> **Service**: Sure. Please count the frequency of the words in "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" but please ignore the words "the" and "dog".
> 
> **Client**: Ok, the original text was "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" and in this text, ignoring the words  "the" and "dog", "quick" appeared once, "brown" appeared once, "fox" appeared once, "jumped" appeared once, "over" appeared once, "lazy" appeared once, and "the" appeared twice.
> 
> **Service**: Sorry, that's wrong. Nice try space troll.
> 
> **Client**: Oops, what I meant was the original text was "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" and in this text, ignoring the words  "the" and "dog", "quick" appeared once, "brown" appeared once, "fox" appeared once, "jumped" appeared once, "over" appeared once, and "lazy" appeared once.
> 
> **Service**: Looks great.


## Requirements

Write a server that does 2 things

### 1. Respond to a client HTTP request

Respond to a client HTTP request with at least the following in the response body:

1. A random body of text. Some sample texts are included.
2. A list of some but not all words in that body of text (exception: texts with only one unique word should use an empty list)

### 2. Receive a client HTTP request

Receive a client HTTP request with at least the following in the request

1. A body of text
2. A list of some but not all words in that body of text (exception: texts with only one unique word should have an empty list)
3. A count of the frequency of every word in the body of text excluding words from the list

and respond with:

1. If the word frequency count is correct, then `200 OK`
2. If the word frequency count is incorrect or the request is otherwise invalid, then `400 Bad Request`

You are *not* required to write the client application, but you can assume that a client for this server should:

1. Request from 1
2. Count the frequency of each word in the given body of text minus all of the given exclusion words
3. Send to 2 the word frequency count result with the original response body from 1.

### Readme

Writing software in a fast-paced, independent environment involves discovering and resolving many ambiguities. Your ability to make good assumptions and trade-offs is key. Keep the objective of the assignment in mind when making such decisions. Please include a readme document in your submission that describes any assumptions or decisions.

### Tests

Quality assurance is *very important* for maintaining a successful defense against the alien trolls. Please include a means to automatically assert the correctness of your code. This can be unit tests that validate the correctness of individual small pieces of code or functional tests that verify expected responses from particular endpoints. However you choose to implement tests, it must be automated and simple to run. It should not be a matrix of complicated human-driven steps and comparisons.

## Guidelines

1. You should feel free to write your solution in whichever language you are most comfortable writing.
2. Style, algorithms, data structures, request/response format, etc. are all up to you. However, keep in mind that we will be looking at these choices.
2. If your service can run on a Unix environment (e.g. ) Mac OSX, then please include the following:
    1. Any installation instructions or notes to set up our Mac OSX laptops to run your server
    2. A script `./run` to start the server
    3. The server should run on `localhost:8000` and serve a single path `/`
3. If your service _cannot_ run on Mac OSX, then please run your server on a remote host and provide us the hostname, port, and path to access it.
4. An open ended task like this can be expanded and improved infinitely. One could work on it forever, continously making little tweaks here and there. Meanwhile, alien trolls continue to terrorize the internet. This project should take a few hours, but certainly no more than 8. Please set a maximum amount of time to work on this project and submit whatever you have by the end of that time window. If you have not finished to your own satisfaction, please explain everything that you would like to add in your Readme.
5. Treat this assignment as you would an actual work project and _write code as you would in the actual work place_. Please do not write code as you would for a research project in a theoretical quantum computer or as a proof of P=NP.

## Bonus

1. **Cheating Protection**: When the server receives text, exclusion words, and a word count from the client, it verifies that the text and exclusion words that it previously gave a client.
2. **Stateless/Idempotent**: Remove as much "state" as possible from the server. Any new request to the server does not depend on the state of a previous request.
